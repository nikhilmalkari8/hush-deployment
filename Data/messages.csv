Average living cost would be 1300-1400 USD. If you stay close to campus. And again depends on how you spend. Rent itself goes around 1000 USD 2. TA/RA positions are available but competitive. You will start trying very early.  3. Not sure about that but somewhere around 60K. Not really sure 4. Yes you have Indian stores close by and you get everything there 5. For total fees I would say you can calculate on your own. Look at the per credit fee on the website and multiply by 30. As it takes 30 credits to complete your masters. Per credit fee keeps changing every semester ,INBOX

It's always nice to connect with someone from colleges in Rochester.  Quick question - Have you considered widening your skills such as in non-technical, low-cost entrepreneurship/ startup ideas along with your profession? The reason I reached out to you is, outside of being a PhD student, I actively collaborate with a few successful senior professionals, who work on developing strategies geared towards building marketplaces for e-commerce companies.  So, If you do, we can setup a time for an initial zoom connect.",INBOX

Being a grad student in data science, I have a deep understanding of data analysis and data science. I possess an expert level knowledge of Python, R and SQL. I do have a lot of technical projects on data analysis and data science where I have worked using various python libraries like numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, machine learning algorithms and more. I have an intermediate knowledge of MATLAB and I am willing to learn more.  3. I will be able to work from August 2022 through Spring 2023 as an 8-month co-op.  4. As I will be working as a summer intern till August at Nokia where I will be using splunk to develop dashboards used for visualizations, predicting release competition timelines and risks using Machine learning, I will be more than ready for the role as it shares most of the skills needed. Also, as said before, Tesla has been my dream company and I just need a chance to prove myself. I can guarantee if I get an opportunity to work with Tesla, I will work as hard as I can, push myself beyond what I can and learn new skills and technologies to contribute to the company.   Hoping for a favorable consideration. Thank you again  Regards Nikhil Malkari",INBOX

I will be working as a summer intern at Nokia at Murray Hill, NJ where I will be developing splunk dashboards, reports and searching using Machine Learning in order to visualize various aspects of release status and predict release competition timelines and risks. I have good knowledge of data science and analytics and willing to learn more and contribute. Can you please tell me if there are any available coop positions in your team for this fall 2022. I am eager to express myself over a teams/phone call. I will attach my resume for your reference.  Thanks for your time  Regards Nikhil Malkari",INBOX

I'm Kaushik currently in my final year undergrad program(Bvrit) from India. I got admitted to the master's in DS program at RIT. I would love to learn more about your journey at RIT. Do you think that the program is worth it based on your experience and how was your job search? I'm more interested in the intersection of machine learning and data science, so I wanted to work in these fields after I graduate. And how is the location for Job search and internships? And how are the coursework in terms of the industry standards? Thanks for your time and any suggestions or useful information will be really useful for me! Have a great day!",INBOX

RIT is famous and well known for computing sciences. I like the curriculum of it. I felt the structure of the courses was really good. Electives and all. Also RIT coop program is good. These were the reasons for me to come to RIT 2. I did not get any TA/RA position. RIT is not a research oriented university. So not a lot of RA positions. You get a lot TA positions in Information science department. But it will be a bit difficult as we are from other major. But we can get them. Other part time are dining jobs for first semester. You can start applying for desk jobs later in 2nd semester. 3. Personally, I like the course a lot. Theres only one course which i found a bit different from data Science career path. Rest of them are good. Electives and all as I said are pretty good. Lot of diverse options. 4. If you keep your financials correct, it’ll be 100% 5. You get a lot of unofficial WhatsApp groups where u can decide housing.  6 and 7. Internships coops and full times should be applied online. That is everywhere. You don’t get any assistance from any university.  8. You will have a course named software construction which is on java. It’ll be from basic java to advanced java.

By quickly examining your resume, I noticed that although on a surface level it looks great, there are various areas that could use significant improvements. Generally, I believe that despite your strong background, you would not be able to impress most sourcers or recruiters. I do believe that since you have some great experience, you definitely have what it takes to get even better opportunities going forward.  I'd however hate for you to lose out on opportunities simply because of your current resume, which has glaring flaws. I'm also not convinced your resume is 100% ATS Compliant. While I can go into specifics, that's part of our paid session, which we hope you would opt-in for since we believe we can bring you strong value through the service.  As a next step, please go ahead and continue with the payment on our website https://www.faangpath.com/pricing. You can opt for any plan if you see the need and value for it.

PROS: You get a decent education in Machine learning and data mining  Professors are well qualified and have many years of experience in this field. If you are interested, you can even propose to work in the labs.  For most of the courses, you will have practical assignments as well as written exams. Your workload gets shared.  You can go for an exchange program in the second year to countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and so on.  As you may know, the cost of living in the city is cheaper than in many other cities in France.  CONS: As I said earlier that the professors are well qualified, You will still find it a little difficult to follow the lectures because they are always taught at a very high level. You must try to do pre-study the topics before attending any lecture.  For some of the courses, I personally find that there is so much of a gap between the theory and the practicals. This is my opinion. It might not be correct as well.  As most of the projects and practical assignments are designed in a such way that it can only be done in a team of 3 or 4. Your main challenge will be to find a good team who are willing to work.  Semesters are too short. You have to be a quick learner.  Overall, I would rate UJM as 5/10. For the money you afford, you get a decent education. Honestly, when you compare the standard of education in Germany, UJM standards are not so great!!😊 All the best",INBOX

Even in the covid times, most of the students had internships and similarly for full time jobs. Obviously, getting a full time job is much harder unless you are extended an offer after the internship itself. For co-ops, again it is generally the companies you interned for could make a co-op offer as well otherwise pretty difficult to secure a co-op. I don’t know the exact number but I assume it should be more than 50% for students getting co-op. In addition, you generally get assistantships for atleast 2 semesters which is a big plus as fees is reduced by 70-75% and you get a decent salary as well.  Regarding course curriculum, it would cover aspects of machine learning, statistics course is pretty good and you have an option to choose courses like python, sql, big data, data warehousing, tableau, SAS etc. It would mainly depend on what you are ready to learn and work for.  Thanks!",INBOX

Of course, if you have previous experience or projects, you have an advantage. And it is advisable to brush up some basic Math and Programming concepts if at all you want to join this school.

I've just started the MS program this semester so I can only give you info from that perspective. So far the program has been pretty much according to my expectations when I applied to it. I finished my bachelor's last year in data analytics and wanted to learn more before applying myself to an industry job. The program is geared more towards professionals who want that better job/salary and less towards research or academia. The courses are well designed to meet the needs of a growing data science market though I found some course material too basic. However, the department is flexible and did let me waive the intro class; they are also open to substituting classes from other departments if they suit your needs better.   I already have an internship lined up for the coming summer so I have not explored this much but there are a lot of networking and internship opportunities coming in every week at GW. Again, this is my first semester so I don't yet know how useful those opportunities end up being.",INBOX

You would be able to get a lot of good internships and works with your projects.   A lot of people change their background in Masters.
